PICOS> is an OS for Raspberry Pi Pico with a ST7789 240x240 IPS display and currently supports 4 buttons to control the CLI interface. Purposefully minimal design with an onscreen "virtual keyboard" cursor that allows you to cycle through keys to select the keyboard key you want to type. It's support includes LittleFS file system for file management, has a purpose built file transfer app to transfer files to the LittleFS file system from a PC. There are still many bugs but the system is considered "stable" for use. The commands you can execute are displayed using the help command including HELP, PI, ECHO, LS, CAT, CALC, RM, VER, TIME, SEND, FKEY, CLEAR. The system is based on a char by char rendering method to keep redraw bugs at bay and to help dampen the load on the CPU. Boot time is about 1 second allowing for a powerful CLI interface to store files or run commands/programs with just a few buttons. The concept for this is being able to run a terminal application on a small portable Pico game console and transfer files to PC.
